## Assignment Overview

A typical T&T prospectus defense presentation is 15-20 minutes: as at this stage you are still conceptualizing your project, so our practice run will be shorter. This is an opportunity to share your concept formally and practice for what can be a particularly stressful stage of the process.

## Q & A

All students are expected to perform the role of the committee when asking questions:
- Think about challenges of scope, particularly given the limited time of a dissertation
- Be considerate when raising sources, methods, and ideas from your own exerptise - everyone brings different backgrounds to their work
- Remember to focus your questions on helping your peers clarify the projects they want to do, even if that's not the project you would do!

## Preparation Tips

- Practice your presentation multiple times to stay within the 10-12 minute limit
- Time each section to ensure proper balance (methodology should be longest)
- Prepare for potential questions, especially about your research methods
