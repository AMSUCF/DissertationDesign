## Assignment Overview

Each section draft is intended to get you started on your prospectus. Basically, these act as mini-versions of specific sections of the prospectus itself - in this case, the Focused Literature Review. This is often an extensive section of the prospectus, but for this draft, focus on contextualizing your research within existing scholarship and aim for a 3-4 page overview.

## Purpose

This focused literature review should demonstrate how you situate your project within existing scholarship and clearly articulate what new contribution your research will make. Remember, this is not a comprehensive literature reviewâ€”that will appear in your full dissertation. Instead, this section provides essential contextualization for your committee to understand your project's place in the scholarly conversation.

## Key Components

Your focused literature review should address two essential elements:

### Current Scholarly Debates
**What do scholars already know about your topic?**

Provide a well-focused summary of the current debate(s) in your chosen subfield. This section should:
- Identify the key conversations and controversies in your area of research
- Show how different scholars have approached your topic or related questions
- Demonstrate your understanding of where the field currently stands
- Highlight areas of consensus and disagreement among scholars
- Allow your committee to see how you situate your project in existing literature

### Specific Contributions and Positioning
**How will your research contribute to existing knowledge?**

Outline in precise terms the specific contribution(s) your dissertation will make to the subfield:

- **If studying a neglected subject:** Specify what part of that subject has been missed, and how your study will fill the gap
- **If building on existing literature:** Say what has been achieved, and how your proposal adds to it
- **If conducting case studies:** Justify your selection of cases with reference to theory and explain why these particular cases matter
- **Research focus:** Include specific subjects or questions your project intends to investigate, with rationale for developing these

## Structure Guidelines

### Organization Approach
- Begin with broader scholarly conversations and narrow to your specific contribution
- Organize thematically around key debates rather than chronologically or source-by-source
- Show clear connections between different scholarly positions
- Maintain focus on literature most directly relevant to your project

### Contextualization vs. Comprehensiveness
- This should **contextualize** your research, not review literature comprehensively
- Focus on scholarship that directly informs your research questions and methodology
- Include foundational works that established key concepts or approaches
- Emphasize recent scholarship that represents current thinking in the field

## Submission Instructions

Submit your focused literature review through Webcourses as a Word document or PDF. Use clear subheadings to organize your discussion of current debates and your specific contributions. Ensure proper academic citations throughout and include a bibliography of all sources referenced.
