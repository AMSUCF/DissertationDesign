## Assignment Overview

The goal of the pre-proposal is to articulate the concept and driving impetus for your dissertation project: remember, you might be working on this for several years, so it should be a well-defined project that lays the foundation for your scholarly identity and work going forward.

## Key Components

Your pre-proposal must address the following six elements:

### 1. Problem Statement (1 point)
Clearly articulate the specific problem, gap, or question that your dissertation will address. Explain why this issue matters to you, the field, and why it requires scholarly attention now.

### 2. Research Question(s) (3 points)
Present your central research questions. These should be focused, feasible, and aligned with T&T's interdisciplinary approach. Remember, these must be answerable with your funding and in the scope of your time! Stick to no more than three.

### 3. Research Design Overview (3 points)
Briefly outline your proposed methodology and approach. What types of data, materials, or evidence will you examine and/or collect? Note any potential IRB considerations for human subjects research.

### 4. Categories of Literature (2 points)
Identify the main scholarly conversations and bodies of literature your dissertation will engage. This might include specific subfields within T&T, interdisciplinary connections, theoretical frameworks, or methodological traditions. Show awareness of how your work will contribute to existing scholarship. Who are you in conversation with?

### 5. Significance of Contribution (3 points)
Explain the potential impact and importance of your proposed research. Try to answer the question that a lot of humanities research raises: so what?

### 6. Preliminary Chapter Outline (3 points)
Provide a bulleted list of the focusing principles of each of your five chapters. Will your dissertation follow a social science or more humanities structure? Keep in mind the models we've reviewed.

## Submission Instructions
